    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>

    <p>This week I am extremely excited about a new
    cooking technique called <dfn><b>sous vide</b></dfn>. <br>In sous vide
    cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed
    in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely
    set to the target temperature you want the food
    to be cooked to. <br>In his book,<cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>,
    Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature
    poaching.</p>
    <p>Next month, we will be serving <i>Sous Vide Salmon</i>
        with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef
    table, contact us <em>before</em><time datetime="2016-11-30">November 30</time>. </p>

    pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have
    immunity issues.</small></p>
